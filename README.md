# SkinScreening
This repository contains the preprocessing and the final convolutional neural networks for the skin lesion classification of the [HAM10000](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018161) data set. The data was analysed in order to be used in the [Virtual Doctor](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31607340/) project as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. The project was partily funded by hessen.AI.
